# EN0617 - Manufacturing Production Cell 

## Introduction
This repository contains code for use with the manufacturing production cell used
in the Professionalism and Industrial Case Project. The repository contains drivers
for the robots, conveyor belt and control panel. There are a number of test programs 
for the drivers and the CAN bus. There are also frameworks for using uC/OS-II and a 
time-trggered scheduler. The code assumes implementation using Olimex LPC2378-STK boards
and the IAR EWARM tools.
